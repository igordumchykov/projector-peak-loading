I dont think it might be high load, but in case of a high load, because comments might be stored in some document DB, we might have to use DB sharding and replication to separate read/write requests, reduce load for the single node, load balance traffic between read replicas. |                                         |

General Approaches to Handle Peaks
1. Use CDN to cache static content and deliver traffic to the end users from locations closer to them.
2. Reduce page weight for a website, also use CDN to cache data.
3. Use monitoring tools to analyze which components might be a bottleneck in the system and might be under the pressure during peaks. Based on this
configure autoscaling plans for up-scaling and down-scaling during peak periods.
4. Horizontal/vertical scaling, load balancing between servers.
5. Use caching layer on server side.
6. Use DDoS protection service (e.g. Cloudflare)
7. Fo DB usage: consider db sharding and replication, query optimization and caching, using secondary indexes if needed.
8. Use rate limiting for resource intensive operations.
9. Identify flows that can be handled in async manner, use message queues to decouple services, handle asynchronous tasks and distribute traffic.
10. Consider using microservices in case when different parts of the system should be scaled independently.
